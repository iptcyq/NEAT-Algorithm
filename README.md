# NEAT-Algorithm
Attempt at creating the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) from scratch

I was reading a paper on it while do research for another machine learning project. This looked interesting so I wanted to recreate it. :)

- *stanley.ec02.pdf* : The paper on the NEAT Algorithm that I am referring to (Source: https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/soft-view.php?SoftID=4)
- *AlgoTestNEAT.ipynb* : Jupyter Notebook to code
- *AlgoTestGame.ipynb* : Eventual game/ simulation for the machine to train on (Not working on this yet)
- Yet to add a folder for actual modules/ files


Note: I have been working on this on and off for quite a while so no idea when it will be done

| Timeframe | Progress |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 2022/ 2023/ I forgot the date | Main Node, Connection, Genome classes |
| Mid 2025 | Debugging/ adding more mutations |
